# Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus

This page provides supplementary materials for the poster “Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus” presented at SBQT 2025.
It includes additional results that complement the data shown in the poster, offering a deeper look into the molecular organization and interactions within the viral envelope.

# About the Study

The Zika virus envelope is a highly organized and dynamic structure where lipids, ions, and water molecules play essential roles in maintaining viral stability and infectivity.
To investigate these effects, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations based on the cryo-EM structure of the mature Zika virus, followed by analyses using ComplexMixtures.jl, a Julia package for solute–solvent interaction studies in heterogeneous systems.

# Extended Results

Supplementary analyses include:

• Dynamic behavior of POC, POE and POS during 2000 ns of simulation;

• Dynamic solvation and water coordination around key viral residues;
