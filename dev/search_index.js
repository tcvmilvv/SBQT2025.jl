However, obtaining atomic resolution of these light and dynamic components remains a significant challenge for traditional experimental techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, which often provide a static view [1] [2]. To overcome these limitations, this study used coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations to investigate in detail the distribution and behavior of these elements in the structure of the mature Zika virus. The quantitative analysis, performed with the ComplexMixtures.jl package, focuses on deciphering the specific interactions between the viral envelope proteins and the different solvent components, such as water molecules (WT4) and the lipid bilayer [3] [4].","category":"page"},{"location":"#Computational-Details","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Computational Details","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","text":"Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to explore the organization and dynamics of the mature Zika virus envelope. The initial coordinates were taken from the cryo-electron microscopy structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6CO8). The complete viral system, including the lipid bilayer and solvent environment, was assembled using PACKMOL (version 18.169), ensuring the correct spatial distribution of proteins, lipids, and water molecules.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","text":"All molecular entities were described using the SIRAH 2.0 coarse-grained force field, which balances structural accuracy with computational efficiency. Simulations were performed with the GROMACS package (version 2018.4, http://www.gromacs.org), employing GPU acceleration. Temperature and pressure were maintained at 300 K and 1 bar, respectively, using the V-rescale thermostat and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","text":"Nonbonded interactions were calculated using a 12 Å cutoff, and long-range electrostatics were handled via the particle mesh Ewald (PME) approach. Integration of Newton’s equations of motion was achieved using the leapfrog algorithm with an adaptive timestep: 2 fs during equilibration, later increased to 20 fs for production runs. Neighbor lists were updated every 10 steps, and coordinates were recorded every 100 ps for post-simulation analysis.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","text":"To characterize the organization of light molecular components—such as water molecules and ions—around the viral envelope, analyses were performed using the ComplexMixtures.jl package.

For each frame of the trajectory, the algorithm iterates through all solute–solvent pairs, computing interatomic distances and counting those within a chosen cutoff radius (r<sub>c</sub>). Each qualifying solvent molecule contributes to the instantaneous CN of the corresponding solute site. The resulting time-resolved CN profiles reveal how solvent density and organization fluctuate around specific protein regions throughout the simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","text":"This calculation process is illustrated schematically in Figure X: <br>\n\n• A solute atom (e.g., from the viral envelope protein) is defined as the reference center. <br>\n\n• Distances (r<sub>i</sub>) to surrounding solvent atoms are measured. <br>\n\n• All atoms within r<sub>c</sub> are counted, giving CN = N(r<sub>i</sub> ≤ r<sub>c</sub>). <br>","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","text":"Through this method, we obtained a high-resolution picture of local hydration and ionic structuring around protein domains and membrane regions, enabling quantitative assessment of solvent accessibility and the dynamic heterogeneity of the viral microenvironment.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Results-and-Discussion-Extended-Analyses","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Results and Discussion - Extended Analyses","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Structure-of-the-Virus","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Structure of the Virus","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","title":"Dynamics and Specificity in the Microenvironment of the Zika Virus","text":"<figure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"../figures/Figure1.png\" style=\"width:70%\">\n  <figcaption>Figure 1.
